This was my first time coding within C and was fun to work with an arduino for the first time. I was part of the networking group that had us attach our Arduino to a shield that simulated a network with hosts that we could ping. Our job was to then ping them at the correct time and the correct way in order to collect data.</p>"

The assignment had us make a terminal based revision app in the Java programming language using various OOP principles such as Abstraction, Encapsulation and Polymoprhism. Combinging these I created a highly cohesevie application with low coupling.</p>"

The assignment was developed in C with a written report how we could've done it in C++ using OOP principles. My C implementation was fairly OOP like though making use of function pointers to switch between menus. The assignment itself was about a program for a microcontroller our lecturer had previously made in order to feed his fish. Though we were not able to code it on the acctual microcontroller our lecturer provided us a simulated environment using Java and JavaFX with functions to interact with said environment.</p>"

It also went over runtime and making efficient algorithms to solve problems and ways you may solve problems including dynamic programming. The assignment (in Java) had us conform to interfaces provided to us in order to find words that rhymed within a large dictionary. This assignment was paticularly interesting as it had me thinking even harder about ways to solve the problem as we would recieve a better mark for a more efficient algorithm.</p>"

Originally it started as a grey and bland static page using just HTML and CSS. This then had an attempt at a facelift by trying to improve my colorscheme. Next, having kept hearing about react, I decided to convert my website into react native to get some experience within react. This was an interesting experience and was fun learning about it and I intend to mess with react more in the future though it will probably be in a framework instead of native. I stayed on my react native website for a while before deciding it needed a refresh.</p><p class=\"pl-2 pt-2 text-l\">That brings us to this iteration of the website done in HTML, CSS and JS and making use of tailwind to make writing my CSS faster and improve the look of my website easier.</p>"
